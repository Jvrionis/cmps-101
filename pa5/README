Makefile: List.c, List.h, Graph.h, Graph.c, GraphTest.c,
FindComponents.c

List.c: Doubly linked list data structure used to store an
integer data capable of traversing the list via index, that
is, index of cursor.

List.h: Header file for List ADT. 

Graph.h: Header file for Graph ADT that exports the 
following functions.

Graph.c: Graph ADT used to perform Depth-First Search on 
Graphs stored within.

GraphTest.c: A test file for Graph ADT.

FindComponents.c:  This file should: 1)Read the input file.
  2) Assemble a graph object G using newGraph() and addArc(). 
  3) Print the adjacency list representation of G to the 
  output file.
  4) Run DFS on G and GT , processing the vertices in the 
  second call by decreasing finish times from the first call. 
  5) Determine the strong components of G.
  6) Print the strong components of G to the output file in 
  topologically sorted order
